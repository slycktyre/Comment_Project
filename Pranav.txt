This semester, we completed units on looping, conditionals, functions, and data structures including lists, sets, and dictionaries. In addition, we completed a statistics-related unit on simulations and plotting. The projects this semester included simulating the game of craps and completing a larger partner project on simulating customer service at a bank. Total of 4 problem sets and 2.

Pranav has been focused in class, but often works alone and isn't engaged with the class. However, it is sometimes clear that Pranav has not completed the homework for that day when he comes to class, this is definitely something that he should improve on in the future. In the classroom, Pranav seems to be barely trying when collaborating and should improve their attitude in the future. 

Pranav started off the semester strong with a 93% on his first test, but finished with a 79% on the semester final and a 82.75% average. In addition, he averaged an 85.25% on unit problem sets, showing his ability to apply most material covered to complicated problems. However, his still has room for improvement.

The first semester of comperter science can be very intense to those who are new to the subject, and Pranav's consistant lack of care for his work is very concerning, not only lacking respect to my class in class but also lacking any desire to learn. I am very disappointed with Pranav's efforts and I am very unhappy with the semester as a whole. For this semester, Pranav is given a B.
