This semester, we completed units on looping, conditionals, functions, and data structures including lists, sets, and dictionaries. In addition, we completed a statistics-related unit on simulations and plotting. The projects this semester included simulating the game of craps and completing a larger partner project on simulating customer service at a bank. Total of 4 problem sets and 2.

In the classroom, Ashok is a great collaborator and I hope to see this aptitude to continue. I am glad to say that he has been very focused and engaged during class. However, it is sometimes clear that Ashok has not completed the homework for that day when he comes to class, this is definitely something that he should improve on in the future. 

Ashok started off the semester with failing grades, but with diligent work, he pushed his test average to a C with a 91% on his semester final. I hope to see this improvement continue with weekly meetings during office hours. However, he averaged an 67% on unit problem sets, showing his inability to apply what he learned to more complicated problems. Ashok should definitely meet with me at least twice a week to discuss coding problems.

The first semester of comperter science can be very intense to those who are new to the subject, Ashok seem enthusiastic to learn the topic while in the classroom but the serious lack of homework counters what seems to be a possible outlet. I hope that if there is anything I can do, help let me know and I hope the best for Ashok's future studies. For this semester, Ashok is given a D.
