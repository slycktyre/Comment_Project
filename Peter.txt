This semester, we completed units on looping, conditionals, functions, and data structures including lists, sets, and dictionaries. In addition, we completed a statistics-related unit on simulations and plotting. The projects this semester included simulating the game of craps and completing a larger partner project on simulating customer service at a bank. Total of 4 problem sets and 2.

Peter has diligently completed the nightly homework and comes to class prepared. I am glad to say that he has been very focused and engaged during class. However, in the classroom, Peter seems to be barely trying when collaborating and should improve their attitude in the future. 

Peter averages an A with a cumulative 100% on tests, demonstrating knowledge of the topics covered, which I hope to see continue. In addition, he averaged an 100% on unit problem sets, showing his impressive ability to apply what he learned to complicated problems.

The first semester of comperter science can be very intense to those who are new to the subject, and Peter's consistant work and engament is extremely promising. he shows consistant engament inside the classroom but outside as well with his homework. I am very pleased with Peter's efforts and I am pleased with the semester as a whole. For this semester, Peter is given a A.
