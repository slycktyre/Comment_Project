This semester, we completed units on looping, conditionals, functions, and data structures including lists, sets, and dictionaries. In addition, we completed a statistics-related unit on simulations and plotting. The projects this semester included simulating the game of craps and completing a larger partner project on simulating customer service at a bank. Total of 4 problem sets and 2.

It is sometimes clear that Billy has not completed the homework for that day when she comes to class, this is definitely something that he should improve on in the future. In the classroom, Billy's collaboration is terrible. I have never seen such disregard to other peers. Billy has seemed often distracted and unengaged in class. 

With a test score average of a D with 64.75%, it seems as though Billy lacks a solid grasp of the material. In addition, she averaged an 66.5% on unit problem sets, showing her inability to apply what she learned to more complicated problems. Billy should definitely meet with me at least twice a week to discuss coding problems.

The first semester of comperter science can be very intense to those who are new to the subject, and Billy's consistant lack of care for her work is very concerning, not only lacking respect to my class in class but also lacking any desire to learn. I am very disappointed with Billy's efforts and I am very unhappy with the semester as a whole. For this semester, Billy is given a F.
