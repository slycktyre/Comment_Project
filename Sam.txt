This semester, we completed units on looping, conditionals, functions, and data structures including lists, sets, and dictionaries. In addition, we completed a statistics-related unit on simulations and plotting. The projects this semester included simulating the game of craps and completing a larger partner project on simulating customer service at a bank. Total of 4 problem sets and 2.

Sam has been focused in class, but often works alone and isn't engaged with the class. In the classroom, Sam is a great collaborator and I hope to see this aptitude to continue. However, it is sometimes clear that Sam has not completed the homework for that day when he comes to class, this is definitely something that he should improve on in the future. 

Sam started the semester strong with a 90% on his first test, and found room to improve his coding even more with a 94% on his final, pushing Sam's average test score to 91.25. In addition, he averaged an 88.5% on unit problem sets, showing his ability to apply most material covered to complicated problems. However, his still has room for improvement.

The first semester of comperter science can be very intense to those who are new to the subject, and Sam's consistant lack of care for his work is very concerning, not only lacking respect to my class in class but also lacking any desire to learn. I am very disappointed with Sam's efforts and I am very unhappy with the semester as a whole. For this semester, Sam is given a B+.
