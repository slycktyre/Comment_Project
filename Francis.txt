This semester, we completed units on looping, conditionals, functions, and data structures including lists, sets, and dictionaries. In addition, we completed a statistics-related unit on simulations and plotting. The projects this semester included simulating the game of craps and completing a larger partner project on simulating customer service at a bank. Total of 4 problem sets and 2.

In the classroom, Francis is a great collaborator and I hope to see this aptitude to continue. I am glad to say that she has been very focused and engaged during class. However, it is sometimes clear that Francis has not completed the homework for that day when she comes to class, this is definitely something that he should improve on in the future. 

Francis averages a B on tests with 85.25%, good work, but still a bit to improve on. In addition, she averaged an 85.5% on unit problem sets, showing her ability to apply most material covered to complicated problems. However, her still has room for improvement.

The first semester of comperter science can be very intense to those who are new to the subject, Francis seem enthusiastic to learn the topic while in the classroom but the serious lack of homework counters what seems to be a possible outlet. I hope that if there is anything I can do, help let me know and I hope the best for Francis's future studies. For this semester, Francis is given a B.
