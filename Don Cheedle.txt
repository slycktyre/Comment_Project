This semester, we completed units on looping, conditionals, functions, and data structures including lists, sets, and dictionaries. In addition, we completed a statistics-related unit on simulations and plotting. The projects this semester included simulating the game of craps and completing a larger partner project on simulating customer service at a bank. Total of 4 problem sets and 2.

Don Cheedle has diligently completed the nightly homework and comes to class prepared. Don Cheedle has been focused in class, but often works alone and isn't engaged with the class. However, in the classroom, Don Cheedle's collaboration is terrible. i have never seen such disregard to other peers. 

Don Cheedle averages an A with a cumulative 94.75% on tests, demonstrating knowledge of the topics covered, which I hope to see continue. In addition, he averaged an 92.25% on unit problem sets, showing his impressive ability to apply what he learned to complicated problems.

The first semester of comperter science can be very intense to those who are new to the subject,  and Don Cheedle's homework assignments are very thorough, expressing a well balanced understanding of the assignments, however the productive attitude of his is lacking in the classroom. I hope in the future that he takes class time more seriously if homework is to indicate some sort of intrest. For this semester, Don Cheedle is given a A.
