This semester, we completed units on looping, conditionals, functions, and data structures including lists, sets, and dictionaries. In addition, we completed a statistics-related unit on simulations and plotting. The projects this semester included simulating the game of craps and completing a larger partner project on simulating customer service at a bank. Total of 4 problem sets and 2.

In the classroom, Andy is decent when collaboring and has potential to being even better. However, it is sometimes clear that Andy has not completed the homework for that day when he comes to class, this is definitely something that he should improve on in the future. Andy is not the most productive during class, but is thouroughly engaged with class discussion. 

With a test score average of a D with 60.25%, it seems as though Andy lacks a solid grasp of the material. In addition, he averaged an 69.75% on unit problem sets, showing his inability to apply what he learned to more complicated problems. Andy should definitely meet with me at least twice a week to discuss coding problems.

The first semester of comperter science can be very intense to those who are new to the subject, Andy seem enthusiastic to learn the topic while in the classroom but the serious lack of homework counters what seems to be a possible outlet. I hope that if there is anything I can do, help let me know and I hope the best for Andy's future studies. For this semester, Andy is given a C.
