This semester, we completed units on looping, conditionals, functions, and data structures including lists, sets, and dictionaries. In addition, we completed a statistics-related unit on simulations and plotting. The projects this semester included simulating the game of craps and completing a larger partner project on simulating customer service at a bank. Total of 4 problem sets and 2.

In the classroom, Alden is decent when collaboring and has potential to being even better. I am glad to say that he has been very focused and engaged during class. Alden has diligently completed the nightly homework and comes to class prepared. 

Alden averages an A with a cumulative 91.5% on tests, demonstrating knowledge of the topics covered, which I hope to see continue. In addition, he averaged an 91% on unit problem sets, showing his impressive ability to apply what he learned to complicated problems.

The first semester of comperter science can be very intense to those who are new to the subject, and Alden's consistant work and engament is extremely promising. he shows consistant engament inside the classroom but outside as well with his homework. I am very pleased with Alden's efforts and I am pleased with the semester as a whole. For this semester, Alden is given a A-.
