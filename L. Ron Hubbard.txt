This semester, we completed units on looping, conditionals, functions, and data structures including lists, sets, and dictionaries. In addition, we completed a statistics-related unit on simulations and plotting. The projects this semester included simulating the game of craps and completing a larger partner project on simulating customer service at a bank. Total of 4 problem sets and 2.

L. Ron Hubbard has diligently completed the nightly homework and comes to class prepared. In the classroom, L. Ron Hubbard is a great collaborator and I hope to see this aptitude to continue. I am glad to say that he has been very focused and engaged during class. 

L. Ron Hubbard averages an A with a cumulative 100% on tests, demonstrating knowledge of the topics covered, which I hope to see continue. In addition, he averaged an 100% on unit problem sets, showing his impressive ability to apply what he learned to complicated problems.

The first semester of comperter science can be very intense to those who are new to the subject, and L. Ron Hubbard's consistant work and engament is extremely promising. he shows consistant engament inside the classroom but outside as well with his homework. I am very pleased with L. Ron Hubbard's efforts and I am pleased with the semester as a whole. For this semester, L. Ron Hubbard is given a A.
