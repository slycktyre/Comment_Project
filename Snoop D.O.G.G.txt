This semester, we completed units on looping, conditionals, functions, and data structures including lists, sets, and dictionaries. In addition, we completed a statistics-related unit on simulations and plotting. The projects this semester included simulating the game of craps and completing a larger partner project on simulating customer service at a bank. Total of 4 problem sets and 2.

Snoop D.O.G.G has diligently completed the nightly homework and comes to class prepared. However, Snoop D.O.G.G has seemed often distracted and unengaged in class. In the classroom, Snoop D.O.G.G seems to be barely trying when collaborating and should improve their attitude in the future. 

Snoop D.O.G.G averages 81.25% on tests, and has been improving. I hope to see his improvement continue. In addition, he averaged an 80.5% on unit problem sets, showing his ability to apply most material covered to complicated problems. However, his still has room for improvement.

The first semester of comperter science can be very intense to those who are new to the subject,  and Snoop D.O.G.G's homework assignments are very thorough, expressing a well balanced understanding of the assignments, however the productive attitude of his is lacking in the classroom. I hope in the future that he takes class time more seriously if homework is to indicate some sort of intrest. For this semester, Snoop D.O.G.G is given a B-.
